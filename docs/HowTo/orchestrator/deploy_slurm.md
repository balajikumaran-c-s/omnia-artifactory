# Deploy Slurm

## Overview

Orchestrator prepares a Slurm cluster for functional groups whose names begin
with `slurm_` and includes `login_node_` and `login_compiler_node_` groups in
the same provisioning path. It registers the nodes in OpenCHAMI, generates
their boot and cloud-init data, creates shared Slurm configuration and Munge
material on the configured storage, and reconfigures a running controller when
the generated configuration changes.

The source provides cloud-init templates for an x86_64 controller, x86_64 and
aarch64 compute nodes, and x86_64 and aarch64 login and compiler-login nodes.
Slurm feature enablement is derived from the Repo Manager catalog; it is not
configured with a `deploy_slurm` boolean.

## Prerequisites

- Complete Repo Manager and Image Build Manager with Slurm content and an image
  for every Slurm and login functional group in the mapping.
- Include at least one functional group whose name starts with
  `slurm_control_node_`. Slurm provisioning stops if it cannot build a
  controller list.
- Provide reachable BMC addresses for physical-server PXE boot and reachable
  admin IPs for node registration.
- Make an NFS export available to the OIM and cluster nodes. The
  `nfs_storage_name` in `omnia_config.yml` must exactly match a mount `name` in
  `storage_config.yml`, and the NFS source must be reachable from the OIM.
- If you configure a separate `vast_storage_name`, it must also match a mount
  entry. When it is omitted, the source uses the Slurm NFS storage for the HPC
  tools path.
- If the catalog enables OpenLDAP, complete its credential and deployment
  preparation before provisioning.

### Slurm storage architecture

The `nfs_storage_name` mount holds the generated Slurm directory structure,
configuration, per-node files, the Munge key, controller tracking data, and the
Pulp certificate. The optional `vast_storage_name` mount supplies the
`hpc_tools` location; when it is absent, the role reuses the NFS storage.

## Procedure

1. Add the Slurm nodes to `pxe_mapping_file.csv` using functional-group names
   supported by the source templates. OS and version segments may appear before
   the architecture suffix, as in the staged sample.

    ```text title="pxe_mapping_file.csv — functional-group examples"
    slurm_control_node_rhel_10_0_x86_64
    slurm_node_rhel_10_0_x86_64
    slurm_node_rhel_10_0_aarch64
    login_node_rhel_10_0_x86_64
    login_node_rhel_10_0_aarch64
    login_compiler_node_rhel_10_0_x86_64
    login_compiler_node_rhel_10_0_aarch64
    ```

   Populate the complete CSV row for every server, including its group,
   service tag, hostname, admin MAC and IP, and BMC data. Configure optional
   InfiniBand fields when used.

2. Configure the first `slurm_cluster` entry in `omnia_config.yml`. The source
   reads the first cluster entry during provisioning.

    ```yaml title="omnia_config.yml"
    slurm_cluster:
      - cluster_name: slurm_cluster
        nfs_storage_name: nfs_slurm
        vast_storage_name: vast_storage
        node_discovery_mode: heterogeneous
    ```

   `node_discovery_mode` accepts the source-documented `heterogeneous` or
   `homogeneous` behavior. For homogeneous groups, optional
   `node_hardware_defaults` entries are keyed by `GROUP_NAME` and can define
   sockets, cores per socket, threads per core, real memory, and optional GRES.

   To customize Slurm configuration, add `config_sources` as mappings or
   absolute file paths. The supported configuration names are `slurm`,
   `slurmdbd`, `cgroup`, `gres`, `acct_gather`, `helpers`, `job_container`,
   `mpi`, `oci`, `topology`, and `burst_buffer`. Set `skip_merge: true` only
   when the supplied configuration must be used without merging.

3. Create matching mounts in `storage_config.yml`. This structure follows the
   staged source input; replace its addresses and exports with your environment.

    ```yaml title="storage_config.yml"
    mounts:
      - name: "nfs_slurm"
        source: "<nfs-server>:<export>"
        mount_point: "/share_omnia"
        fs_type: "nfs"
        mnt_opts: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard,intr"
        mount_on_oim: true
        functional_group_prefix: ["slurm", "login"]

      - name: "vast_storage"
        source: "<vast-server>:<export>"
        mount_point: "/mnt/vast"
        mount_params: "vast_rdma"
        mount_on_oim: true
        functional_group_prefix: ["slurm_node", "login"]
    ```

   Omit both `vast_storage_name` and its mount when separate VAST storage is not
   used.

4. Validate and provision. The `provision` tag processes all functional-group
   categories in the mapping, not only Slurm.

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM"
    cd src/main
    ./omnia.sh --run orchestrator --tags validate
    ./omnia.sh --run orchestrator --tags precheck
    ./omnia.sh --run orchestrator --tags prepare
    ./omnia.sh --run orchestrator --tags provision
    ```

5. For physical nodes, PXE boot the mapped inventory after provisioning:

    ```bash title="Run on: OIM"
    ./omnia.sh --run orchestrator --tags pxeboot
    ```

## Verification

First confirm that Orchestrator registered all expected nodes and configured
all functional groups:

```bash title="Run on: OIM"
cat "$OMNIA_DATA_PATH/orchestrator/output/$OMNIA_PROJECT_NAME/provisioning_report.yml"
cat "$OMNIA_DATA_PATH/orchestrator/output/$OMNIA_PROJECT_NAME/orchestrator_status.yml"
```

After the nodes complete cloud-init, check Slurm from a controller:

```bash title="Run on: Slurm controller"
sinfo
scontrol show node <compute-hostname>
```

The generated Slurm configuration is placed beneath the selected NFS mount in
its `slurm` directory. The source runs `scontrol reconfigure` on a reachable,
running controller when controller configuration files change.

## Next steps

- Use [Add Nodes](../../Operations/add_nodes.md) to extend the mapped inventory.
- Use [Remove Slurm Nodes](../../Operations/remove_slurm_nodes.md) to remove compute nodes with the
  source's active-job protection.
- Use [Configure Slurm](configure_slurm.md) for additional
  source-backed Slurm configuration examples.

## Troubleshooting

**The controller list is empty**

Add a `slurm_control_node_...` functional group to the mapping and rerun the
workflow. The Slurm role fails deliberately when it cannot identify a
controller.

**Storage validation fails**

Confirm that every `nfs_storage_name` exactly matches a mount `name`, that its
`source` contains the `server:export` separator, and that the server is
reachable from the OIM. If directory creation fails, correct the export
permissions and rerun the playbook.

**Slurm does not pick up changed configuration**

Confirm that `slurmctld` is running on a reachable controller and run the same
check used by the source:

```bash title="Run on: Slurm controller"
scontrol reconfigure
sinfo
```

**A custom configuration fails validation**

Use only supported `config_sources` names and absolute values for path
parameters. Review the failed `slurm_conf` task in
`/var/log/omnia/orchestrator/orchestrator.log`.
