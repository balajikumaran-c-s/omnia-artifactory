# network_spec.yml

This file defines the admin network, the optional InfiniBand network, and any
additional DHCP subnets. Orchestrator and Discovery stage independent copies
of this file in their respective project input directories.

## Location

```text
$ORCHESTRATOR_DATA_PATH/input/$OMNIA_PROJECT_NAME/network_spec.yml
$DISCOVERY_DATA_PATH/input/$OMNIA_PROJECT_NAME/network_spec.yml
```

`ORCHESTRATOR_DATA_PATH` and `DISCOVERY_DATA_PATH` default to their respective
component directories under `$OMNIA_DATA_PATH`. Configure the Discovery copy
for node discovery and the Orchestrator copy for provisioning.

Discovery currently reads only `admin_network.subnet` and
`ib_network.subnet`. It uses their first two octets with the last two octets of
each server's BMC address to derive `ADMIN_IP` and `IB_IP`. The Discovery
`validate` tag does not validate this file. Orchestrator consumes and validates
the remaining network fields from its own copy.

## Top-level structure

`network_spec.yml` contains a single top-level key, `Networks`, which is a
YAML list of network definitions.

```yaml title="File: $ORCHESTRATOR_DATA_PATH/input/$OMNIA_PROJECT_NAME/network_spec.yml"
Networks:
  - admin_network:
      oim_nic_name: "eno1"
      subnet: "172.16.107.0"
      netmask_bits: "24"
      primary_oim_admin_ip: "172.16.107.254"
      primary_oim_bmc_ip: ""
      router: "172.16.107.254"
      dynamic_range: "172.16.107.201-172.16.107.250"
      dns: []
      ntp_servers: []
      additional_subnets: []
```

Omit the `ib_network` list item when InfiniBand is not used. When it is present,
both `subnet` and `netmask_bits` must contain valid values; an empty
`ib_network` object does not satisfy the schema.

          dynamic_range: "10.40.1.100-10.40.1.200"
        - subnet: "10.40.3.0"
          netmask_bits: "24"
          router: "10.40.3.1"
          dynamic_range: "10.40.3.100-10.40.3.200"

  - ib_network:
      subnet: "192.168.0.0"
      netmask_bits: "24"
      dns: []
```


!!! note

    - The `router` field is required and specifies the gateway IP address advertised to nodes through DHCP option 3 as their default gateway.
    - In connected deployments, set `router` to the external rack gateway (such as a SONiC switch) which provides connectivity beyond the rack network.
    - In air-gapped deployments, set `router` to the OIM's IP address if the OIM is acting as the rack gateway. If a dedicated router or gateway is available, specify its IP address instead.
    - Sample value: `172.16.107.254`. The schema requires `router`; the runtime
      does not supply this value when it is omitted.
    - Every primary and additional `dynamic_range` must be contained within its
      subnet, must not overlap another configured DHCP range, and must not
      contain the OIM admin address or any static `ADMIN_IP` assigned in the PXE
      mapping file. Orchestrator validates the subnet, range overlap, and OIM
      address relationships, but it does not currently cross-check DHCP pools
      against `ADMIN_IP` values in the PXE mapping file. The administrator must
      reserve those static addresses outside the pools.
    - When `ib_network` is configured, its `netmask_bits` must equal the primary
      admin-network `netmask_bits` because node InfiniBand configuration uses
      the shared prefix length. The current precheck does not enforce this
      equality; verify it before deployment.
