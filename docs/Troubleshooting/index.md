# Troubleshooting Guide

A structured guide for diagnosing and resolving issues across Omnia deployment, provisioning, Kubernetes, Slurm, storage, authentication, and telemetry workflows. Each entry follows a consistent **Symptom > Cause > Resolution** format so you can quickly identify the problem and apply the fix.

## Troubleshooting Approach

When you encounter an issue, follow this general diagnostic flow:

1. **Check logs first.** Most issues leave a clear trace in the logs. For comprehensive logging information, see [Log Management](../Operations/log_management.md).

2. **Verify prerequisites.** Many failures stem from unmet prerequisites (missing packages, wrong OS version, misconfigured networks). Re-check the [Prerequisites Checklist](../GetStarted/prerequisites_checklist.md) for your deployment path.

3. **Inspect container and service status.** Verify that OIM containers and services are running:

    **Execution context: OIM host**

    ```bash
    podman ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
    ```

4. **Use the ochami CLI.** For provisioning issues, the `ochami-cli` provides direct access to the OpenCHAMI state manager for inspecting node inventory, boot status, and hardware state:

    **Execution context: OIM**

    ```bash
    ochami smd component get
    ochami bss boot params get
    ```

5. **Search this section.** Browse the topic-specific pages below or use your browser's search (Ctrl+F) to find your symptom.
